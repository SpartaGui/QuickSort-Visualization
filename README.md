You will need to change the CMD font size to the lowest value possible and fullscreen the CMD
If you want to change the number of elements to sort, you just change the variable "tamanho" in line 6
If your monitor has a too low resolution you will need to lower the number of elements to actually see something (if you are already on the lowest font size possible)
